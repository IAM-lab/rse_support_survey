scientists from using them as places to deposit code.""

""If repositories had a simple, easy to use GUI, alongside the current
command line/GUI interfaces, would this encourage scientists to use
them?""
 
Those questions make presumptions about the current state of affairs and the reasons for that state. E.g. how am I supposed to answer the first question if I think that repositories already have a simple
(or simple enough) GUI?

""Would it be helpful for the repository to 'track changes' to a
script, so they don't have to be documented manually? ""

Is there a repository format that doesn't do that?

""Would you like your institution to have a central repository, which could be used to store all data and code internally?""

The main reason to have an internal repository is to have non-public projects. Without specifying some details what ""internal"" means, it's really hard to answer this question in any meaningful way.

""Would you like a central internal repository to be compatible with an external one...""

Again, what repository is not compatible with github? Everything that uses git is compatible.
